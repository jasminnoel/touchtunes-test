# TOUCHTUNES node exercise

Node skill test from touchtunes. Objective was to create node app that filters through two arrays of objects.

N.B. The project was built on a windows machine and I sometimes have seen difficulties from running an app built on windows on a UNIX machine and vice versa. Please keep that in consideration.
